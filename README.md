# FuncIn Unprotect Evasion Technique Demo

![Banner](Assets/banner.png)

## Description

This demonstration showcases the utilization of FuncIn evasion technique for spawning a remote shell. Instead of embedding the remote shell code directly within the loader, the entire remote shell function is transmitted over the network as a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled shellcode. Subsequently, it is executed on a dedicated thread of the loader.

This project serves as a template for both practicing and comprehending how malware authors employ advanced techniques to create highly compact and optimized malware. Furthermore, these techniques introduce additional complexity to the reverse engineering process. Unlike conventional methods where the final payloads are directly embedded inside the loader or stored elsewhere (Ex: web server, third part file), this approach involves transmitting them over the network.

The modular nature of the malware, with the final payloads not being directly included in the loader, enhances its evasiveness. The transmitted payloads may also be optionally encrypted or obfuscated, adding an extra layer of defense against detection and analysis. Additionally, the malware may be configured to listen for specific events or behaviors before triggering the transmission of the payload.
